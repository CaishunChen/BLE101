# BLE101
This is a Skecth for Arduino 101 (in USA) / Genuino 101 (out of USA) that allows communication through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to monitor the values of analog pins and modify values of digital pins.

It can be used with the example mobile App BLE 101

_Note: When you try the App, make sure you have bluetooth enabled on the phone._

## Installing the skecth
Arduino 101 looks very similar to arduino UNO, but it is a different boatrd and you can't install the sketches exactly as you would do with UNO.

1) You need Arduino IDE 1.6.7 (or later) - Downloadable from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
2) If you have it already installed, you must use the board

3) If not, you have to install it through Board Manager

And select board Arduino/Genuino 101 (Intel Curie Boards by Intel)

## Firstmakers Perfect Companion
Arduino/Genuino 101 works perfect with shield Firstmakers (www.firstmakers.com) which allows to easily get data from built-in analog sensors and/or connect external modules with standard 3.5mm audio cables.
